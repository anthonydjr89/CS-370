# CS-370
For this project I worked on building a reinforcement learning based intelligent agent, a pirate, that learns how to move through a maze to find hidden treasure. I was given a few main code files to start with, including TreasureMaze.py, GameExperience.py, and a starter version of the qtrain function. These files created the maze setup, handled the memory for storing past moves, and provided the basic training loop using deep Q learning. 

The code I worked on the most was the full qtrain function. I turned off extra print statements so the training output would be easier to follow. I fixed a string formatting problem that caused the program to crash. I also added comments throughout the code to explain what the agent is doing. These updates kept the main logic the same but made the code easier to understand and more reliable.

Computer scientists create software, algorithms, and systems that help solve real-world problems in smart and efficient ways. In this project, the pirate that learns how to find treasure in a maze is a good example. It uses machine learning to get better at making choices, which shows how computer scientists build systems that can learn from experience and adjust to new situations. 

Their work is important because it supports many parts of everyday life, like healthcare, travel, education, and entertainment. Writing code is not just about making things automatic. It is also about creating solutions that are smart, responsible, and able to work well as things grow or change.

Computer scientists like to solve problems by breaking them into smaller parts. In this project, the main goal was to train the agent to find treasure in a maze. I worked on parts like setting up the maze, building the learning process, adjusting settings like how often it explores, and fixing anything that did not work right. 

This way made it easier to find problems, like when the model printed too much or the program crashed because of a formatting issue. I made sure to test each change one at a time. This follows the way engineers work in real life by improving things slowly and carefully.

As a developer, I am responsible for making sure intelligent systems act in safe and fair ways. Even though this maze project is just a simple example, the same kind of learning is used in real systems like cars that drive themselves, banking software, and medical tools. Because of that, it is important that the model learns to make good choices, not just fast ones, and stays within safe limits. 

My job is to write code that is easy to understand and take care of. I also try to avoid creating anything that could cause problems. I keep the needs of both the people using the system and the company building it in mind with every decision.
